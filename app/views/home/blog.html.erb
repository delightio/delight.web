    <h2>Delight adds OpenGL ES support</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      We just launched Delight 2.1, which adds support for OpenGL ES apps. This means that you can now use Delight for usability testing of your OpenGL-based games on iOS. And if you're using a game development framework like Unity or cocos2d - we work with those too! Check out our <a href="/docs/unity">Unity</a> and <a href="/docs/cocos2d">cocos2d</a> integration guides for more information. To learn how to get Delight working with OpenGL ES apps in general, please visit our <a href="/docs/opengles">OpenGL ES Guide</a>.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
      We've also added a new sample project, OpenGLSample, to our <a href="https://github.com/delightio/ios">GitHub repository</a>. Try it out to see our OpenGL screen capturing in action.
