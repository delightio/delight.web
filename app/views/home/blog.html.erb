    <h2>Delight on TechCrunch</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      <a href='http://twitter.com/ryanlawler'>Ryan Lawler</a> from TechCrunch wrote a <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/05/delight-io/''>great article</a> on us.
      <blockquote>Good developers are constantly trying to get feedback on the user experience and navigation of their apps, in an effort to improve them before launch. But few tools exist right now that allow them to do so, outside of just watching beta users over their shoulders.</blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      We were also delighted to receive so many great feedback including <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/05/delight-io/?fb_comment_id=fbc_10150906452181603_22319562_10150906564001603'>one</a> from <a href = 'http://twitter.com/mg'>Matt Galligan</a>
      <blockquote>This seems like it would be extremely valuable to app developers (including us at <a href='http://cir.ca'>Circa</a>).</blockquote>

    <h2>Delight adds OpenGL ES support</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      We just launched Delight 2.1, which adds support for OpenGL ES apps. This means that you can now use Delight for usability testing of your OpenGL-based games on iOS. And if you're using a game development framework like Unity or cocos2d - we work with those too! Check out our <a href="/docs/unity">Unity</a> and <a href="/docs/cocos2d">cocos2d</a> integration guides for more information. To learn how to get Delight working with OpenGL ES apps in general, please visit our <a href="/docs/opengles">OpenGL ES Guide</a>.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
      We've also added a new sample project, OpenGLSample, to our <a href="https://github.com/delightio/ios">GitHub repository</a>. Try it out to see our OpenGL screen capturing in action.
